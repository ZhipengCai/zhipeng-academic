I am interested in machine learning and computer vision problems. During PhD, I was interested in robust geometric perception, which estimates computer vision models (correspondences between images, poses, 3D reconstructions) given outlier contaminated data. I was specifically interested in designing efficient algorithms that have optimality guarantees, i.e., guarantee to return the best solution. After joining Intel, my interests shift towards a mixture of learning and vision, where I study various problems such as 1. learning-based perception (feature matching, finding correspondences, pose estimation, depth estimation etc), 2. Continual Learning, 3. Generative models (e.g., novel view synthesis, image/3D scene generation). Our work has been selected as one of the 12 best papers at ECCV'18.

I have (co-)supervised Ph.D students/interns from various countries (send me an email if you are interested in internships/collaborations, different base locations are possible, e.g., US, Germany, China).
